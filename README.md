# WS Solutions OOP345 
## Profs already decided to deprecate these WSs and assignments. So I might as well unclassify my solutions. Some of them are pretty hardcore. While I was taking this advanced C++ course, there was no ChatGPT at that time.
## I remember using vargrind to patch those memory leaks one by one. 
## I also remember working with that array of ptrs and manually allocate mem on the raw ptrs, which almost killed me. 
## At the end, I can see the my improvements after each WS,and all those good habits learned from this course made me become to a coder with standards. 
## No matter where I am, this is how I started.
